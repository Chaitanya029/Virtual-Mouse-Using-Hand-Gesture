# Virtual-Mouse-Using-Hand-Gesture-
In this project, I am using my hand as a virtual mouse than can do everything that a mouse does without even touching your system. I am using the webcam of my system to detect my hands. It will then create a bounding box around my hand and focus on two fingers: The fore finger and the middle finger.
